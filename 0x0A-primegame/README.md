# Prime Game

## Project Overview

This project involves solving a game theory problem where two players, Maria and Ben, play a game with consecutive integers. The players take turns choosing prime numbers from the set, and then remove that number and its multiples from the set. The player unable to make a move loses the game. The task is to determine the winner of multiple rounds of the game based on optimal play.

## Concepts Covered

- **Prime Numbers**: Understanding prime numbers and efficient algorithms for identifying them.
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit.
- **Game Theory**: Basic principles of competitive games and optimal strategies.
- **Dynamic Programming/Memoization**: Optimizing solutions using previously computed results.
- **Python Programming**: Implementing game logic and algorithms using Python.

## Requirements

- **Python Version**: 3.4.3
- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Code should follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
- **Executable Files**: All files must be executable.
- **Shebang Line**: Each file should start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **File Endings**: All files should end with a new line.
- **No External Packages**: You cannot use any external packages.

## Project Tasks

### Task 0: Prime Game

**Description**: Maria and Ben play a game with a set of consecutive integers from 1 to n. They choose a prime number, remove it and its multiples from the set, and the player unable to make a move loses. Determine the winner for multiple rounds of the game.

**Function Prototype**:
```python
def isWinner(x, nums):
```

- `x`: Number of rounds.
- `nums`: List of integers representing the maximum number in each round.

**Return**: Name of the player who won the most rounds. If the winner cannot be determined, return `None`.

**Example**:
```python
x = 3
nums = [4, 5, 1]
```
- **First Round (4)**: Ben wins.
- **Second Round (5)**: Maria wins.
- **Third Round (1)**: Ben wins.

**Result**: "Ben" has the most wins.

## Usage

To run the code, execute the following command:
```bash
./main_0.py
```

## Repository Structure
