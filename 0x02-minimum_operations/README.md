## Introduction

In this project, you will develop a solution to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to achieve a given number of characters using only “Copy All” and “Paste” operations. This problem requires a good understanding of algorithmic and mathematical concepts, such as dynamic programming, prime factorization, and greedy algorithms.

## Concepts Needed

To solve this problem effectively, the following concepts and resources will be helpful:

- **Dynamic Programming**:
  - Familiarity with dynamic programming helps break down the problem into simpler subproblems and build up the solution.
  - Resource: [Dynamic Programming (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/)

- **Prime Factorization**:
  - Understanding prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number n.
  - Resource: [Prime Factorization (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x15/a/prime-factorization)

- **Code Optimization**:
  - Knowing how to approach problems from an optimization perspective can help in finding the most efficient solution.
  - Resource: [How to optimize Python code](https://realpython.com/python-performance/)

- **Greedy Algorithms**:
  - The problem can also be approached with greedy algorithms, choosing the best option at each step.
  - Resource: [Greedy Algorithms (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/)

- **Basic Python Programming**:
  - Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions, is necessary to implement the solution.
  - Resource: [Python Functions (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)

## Requirements

- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Python Version**: Python 3.4.3
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Style Guide**: PEP 8 (version 1.7.x)
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Your code should be documented.
- All files must be executable.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Minimum Operations

**Objective**: Write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` H characters in the file.

**Prototype**: `def minOperations(n)`

**Returns**: An integer, representing the minimum number of operations required. If `n` is impossible to achieve, return 0.

**Example**:
```python
n = 9
# H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH
# Number of operations: 6
```

**File**: `0-minoperations.py`

**Usage**:
```python
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x02-minoperations$ cat 0-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
Main file for testing
"""

minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations

n = 4
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

n = 12
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

carrie@ubuntu:~/0x02-minoperations$
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x02-minoperations$ ./0-main.py
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x02-minoperations$
```
